# IoT Parking System

The aim of this project was to create an Internet of Things (IoT) system using various sensors that could be marketed and sold as a product; we chose to make an automated parking system using ANPR or RFID for entry, time-of-flight sensors for space occupancy detection, air quality sensors, an OLED screen and a parking portal for user registration, login and history as well as a real-time map showing free/taken spaces.

My role was in the creation of the parking portal, including the front-end (created in HTML, CSS and JS), back-end (created in Flask), real-time NoSQL database using Firebase and writing the I2C implementation of the air quality sensor using SMBus. I also created a system for space recommendation upon entry, depending on the exit preference selected in the portal. The system was designed to be as flexible as possible so potential customers can use their car park layouts easily - all they would need to do is input space locations and entry/exit points.

Here is a demo video of the portal:
