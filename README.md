# IoT Parking System

Folders used in final code: [RaspPi Scripts](RaspPi%20Scripts), [ANPR Scripts](ANPR%20Scripts), [Parking Portal](Parking%20Portal).
Code used for the marketing website is in the folder [Marketing Website](Marketing%20Website).

The aim of this project was to create an Internet of Things (IoT) system using various sensors; we chose to make an automated parking system using ANPR or RFID for entry, time-of-flight sensors for space occupancy detection, air quality sensors and a parking portal for user registration, login and history as well as a real-time map showing free/taken spaces.

My role was in the creation of the parking portal, including the frontend (created in HTML, CSS and JS), backend (created in Flask) and writing the I2C implementation of the air quality sensor using SMBus.
